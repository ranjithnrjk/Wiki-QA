This project is part of my exploration into **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems.

**DEMO**: https://ranjithnrjk.github.io/Wiki-QA/

While this mini demo is just a prototype, it lays the foundation for:

- building my full RAG-based chatbot (Django + Chroma + Laminin LLM),
- learning about deployment via Hugging Face Spaces,
- and creating a personal AI portfolio using Quarto.

Check out more of my experiments on my [Hugging Face profile](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ranjithnrjk).
